# User Guide

Follow this sequence the first time (and each time you switch workspaces):

## Condensed Flow
DB file → Company list → Select/Create company → Add clients → Create invoice → Export PDF → Backup DB.

## Step 1: Select or Create a Database File
- On launch, the app prompts you to choose an existing database file or create a new one (on the first lunch create a new one).
- Recommended: Store it somewhere you already back up (e.g. a synced or encrypted folder).
- You can maintain multiple database files (e.g. one per groups of companies).

## Step 2: Create (or Pick) a Company
- If the database is new, there are no companies yet.
- Create a company with its identity details (name, tax ID, address, contact, logo).
- If companies already exist, you’ll see a list to choose from.

## Step 3: Open a Company context
- Selecting a company “enters” that company context.
- All subsequent actions (clients, invoices) belong to the active company.
- You can exit back to the company selection screen to switch.

## Step 4: Manage Company Data
- Adjust company profile (logo, address, tax ID) as needed.
- Specify default values if needed (default Tax value, currency, footer, etc).
- Changes immediately reflect in future invoices.

## Step 5: Add / Edit Clients
- Create client records (each company has its own client list).
- Keep client data clean. Updates apply to all client invoices, and new PDFs will have the new info.

## Step 6: Create an Invoice
1. Create invoice
2. Select client
3. Add line items (description, quantity, unit price)
4. Set tax rate (single global rate for now)
5. Pick the invoice status (Draft, Pending, etc)
5. (Optional) Add an absolute discount
6. (Optional) Add footer
7. (Optional) Add notes (not render in the PDF)
8. Save / export PDF

## Step 7: Export / Distribute
- Generate PDF (saved locally).
- Send manually (email / upload / print).
